              <br><b><u>Apparatus:</u></b>
             <br><br><b>1.</b> Plane diffraction grating
                <br><b>2.</b> Laser or monochromatic light source
                <br><b>3.</b> Optical bench or flat surface
                <br><b>4.</b> Mounting apparatus (e.g., adjustable slit holder)
                <br><b>5.</b> Screen or white surface for observing the diffraction pattern
                <br><b>6.</b> Meter ruler or measuring tape
                <br><b>7.</b> Protractor or angle measuring tool
                <br><b>8.</b> Optional: Diffraction grating formula or software for calculations
              <br><br><br><b><u>Procedure:</u></b>
            <br><br><b>1.</b> Set up the optical bench or flat surface in a well-lit room, ensuring a stable and level workspace.
                <br><b>2.</b> Mount the plane diffraction grating securely on the bench or surface using the appropriate mounting apparatus. Ensure that the grating is aligned vertically.
                <br><b>3.</b> Position the laser or monochromatic light source such that it illuminates the plane diffraction grating. Make sure the light beam is parallel to the grating surface.
                <br><b>4.</b> Place the screen or white surface a suitable distance away from the grating, ensuring it is perpendicular to the incident light beam.
                <br><b>5.</b> Adjust the position of the screen to find the brightest and clearest diffraction pattern. This may involve moving the screen closer or farther away from the grating until a clear pattern is observed.
                <br><b>6.</b> Observe the diffraction pattern on the screen. You should see a series of bright spots or fringes arranged symmetrically on both sides of the central maximum (zeroth order). This pattern is known as the diffraction pattern or interference pattern.
                <br><b>7.</b> Measure the distance between the grating and the screen. This distance is called the "screen distance" or "observation distance" (D).
                <br><b>8.</b> Measure the distance between adjacent bright spots or fringes on the screen. This is called the "angular separation" (Δθ) or "angular deviation" between the fringes.
                <br><b>9.</b> Use a protractor or angle measuring tool to measure the angle between the incident beam and the direction of the diffracted light for a specific order. This is the "angle of diffraction" (θ).
                <br><b>10</b>. Repeat steps 7-9 for different orders of diffraction (e.g., first order, second order) by adjusting the screen distance or the angle of incidence.
                <br><b>11</b>. Record your measurements and observations in a table.
                <br><b>12</b>. If desired, use the diffraction grating formula or software to calculate the wavelength of the incident light based on the measured values of the angular separation and the angle of diffraction.
             <br><br><b><u>Note:</u></b> The specific steps may vary depending on the equipment and setup you have available. It's always a good idea to consult the manufacturer's instructions or any provided experimental guidelines for the diffraction grating you are using.
